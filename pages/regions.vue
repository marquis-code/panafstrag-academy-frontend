              AAR Mission in the Regions: AAR fosters its mission through
              energetic cultivation of accessible regional intellectual networks
              and identities to serve members where they live and work, and to
              respond to local publics and concerns.

            <p class="leading-loose">
              Essential purposes of the American Academy of Religion as a
              learned society and a professional association are carried out at
              both Academy-wide and regional levels. Activities designed to
              implement these tasks at either level reinforce and supplement the
              work of the other. At present the annual Academy-wide meeting is
              augmented and expanded by ten geographically distinct regional
              meetings.
            </p>

            <p class="leading-loose">
              Regional meetings of the Academy often incorporate patterns of
              organization and presentation similar to those followed at the
              Academy-wide meetings: section meetings, giving and responding to
              papers, plenary speeches. Regional meetings, however, offer unique
              and distinct opportunities for members. Regions have developed a
              distinct character of their own, providing the following
              opportunities:

              While the Board of Directors has supervision of the whole,
              regional officers have direct responsibility for the regions. The
              Regionally Elected Coordinators provide a natural link between the
              interests and concerns of regions and those of the entire Academy.

            <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl text-teal-600">Regions Committee</h2>

            <p class="leading-loose">
              The Regions Committee is a working group of the Board whose
              membership consists of the ten Regionally Elected Coordinators.
              The responsibilities of the committee are defined in its charge:
              The Regions Committee facilitates and supports the work of the
              American Academy of Religion regional structures. In doing so, the
              Committee has responsibility for general issues and for
              development and recommendation of policies relevant to the regions
              and their activities. The Committee administers certain funds for
              the support of regional activities.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-loose">
              The Committee thus has primary responsibility for supporting,
              promoting and developing regional activities. The Committee is the
              initial forum where regional concerns and policies are discussed
              and evaluated before being presented to the Board of Directors. It
              is also the group through which major new initiatives supporting
              the regions can be implemented.

              Regional Development Grants
            </h2>

            <p class="leading-loose">
              Regional Development Grants provide funds for special projects
              within the regions that promise to benefit the scholarly and
              professional life of AAR members and do the work of the AAR in the
              regions. Workshops, special programs, training events and other
              innovative regional projects may be funded through this source.
              Generally, grants funded fall into two categories: seed funding to
              begin ongoing regional initiatives, or one-time funds for special
              projects. Where possible, projects should be designed so that they
              may be duplicated or transported to other regions.
